I could not find any vulnerabilities in our mid term project. The controllers that were scaffolded and methods that post to the database are using ValidateAntiForgeryToken and we used validation in our model classes that took in data. There was no account authorisation and now password to hash or protect. We also used custom error pages to hid any thrown exceptions.

A possible issue would be in a httpPost method not using the ValidateAntiForgeryToken, this would have left our site open to CSRF or Cross Site Request Forgery. This attack can come in a form of a pop up and not require to to click on anything run. While you are logged in the bad site points at the site you are logged into and tricks your browser to give it your validation token.

what it looks like:

[httpPost]
public IActionResult DoTheThing(string arg)
{
  //some code.. 
}

fix:
[httpPost]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public IActionResult DoTheThing(string arg)
{
  //some code.. 
}
